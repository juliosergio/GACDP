This text describes each variable (column) of the resulting data set of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. This data set is produced running the main program "run_analysis" from the R console:

```
 source("run_analysis.R")
```
to get as a result the file "SummaryTable.txt", which in turn can be reloaded into R, as follows:

```
 SummaryTable <- read.table("SummaryTable.txt", header=TRUE)
```
